How does the mobile penetration vary in regions (districts or states) with high or low agricultural workers?

Now this is the most complex problem of all three problems.

So for this we need narrow down the dataframe, so we only have relevant data which we need.

{% highlight python %}
dfc3 = df[["State name","District name","Workers","Households","Agricultural_Workers","Households_with_Telephone_Mobile_Phone"]]
dfc3
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to seperate the data into 2 categories high and low agricultural workers. For this i assume that if more than 50% of workers are in agriculture then it is high agricultural workers, otherwise its low agricultural workers.

{% highlight python %}
dfc3b = dfc3[(dfc3["Agricultural_Workers"]/dfc3["Workers"]*100 > 50)]
dfc3b
{%endhighlight%}

The above code will only show the district which have high agricultural workers

Now we can sum it up according to states

{% highlight python %}
dfc3e = dfc3b.groupby("State name").sum()
dfc3e
{%endhighlight%}

Need the mobile penetration or the number of households having mobiles percentage.

{%highlight python%}
dfc3f = dfc3e["Households_with_Telephone_Mobile_Phone"]/dfc3e["Households"]*100
dfc3f
{%endhighlight%}

Now we have the percentage, now we just need to plot the graph

{%highlight python%}
dfc3f.head(dfc3f.count()).plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()
{%endhighlight%}

The output will look like this

![moblie penetration among the high agricultural workers]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/c3.png)

One part is done now we have to redo the same things for the low agricultural workers

further we can seperate it into district wise in a particular state

{%highlight python%}
dfc3e = dfc3b[(dfc3b['State name'] == 'BIHAR')]
dfc3e = dfc3e.set_index("District name")
dfc3f = dfc3e["Households_with_Telephone_Mobile_Phone"]/dfc3e["Households"]*100
dfc3f.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()
{%endhighlight%}

The above code will plot a graph for the moblie penetration among the high agricultural workers
