This post describes how I solved the Use Case given as Gramener assignment

Following use case I opted for

Indian government carries out census every decade. This dataset contains information from the 2011 census with district level granularity on population, gender, literacy, socioeconomic status (electricity, mobiles, Internet) among a lot of other dimensions.

Questions which are needed to be answered was

1. Create a geographic map of states with low literacy rates.

2. Find out most similar districts in Bihar and Tamil Nadu. Similarity can be based on any of the columns from the data.

3. How does the mobile penetration vary in regions (districts or states) with high or low agricultural workers?
