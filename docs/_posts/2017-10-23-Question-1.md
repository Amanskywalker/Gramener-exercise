Create a geographic map of states with low literacy rates.

To solve the above question first of all need to figure out the literacy rate state wise but no direct data given for it. So need to check out the data which can be used to find the literacy rate.

So the simple way to calculate the literacy rate of the region

$$literacy Rate = {numberOfLitratePeopleInThatRegion \over TotalPopulationOfTheRegion} x 100 $$

So we only need 3 columns to solve this problem State name, Population & Literate.

this code snipt will do that

{% highlight python %}
dfSS = df[["State name","Literate","Population"]] # this will only select the required data form the data frame.
dfSS                                              # Just to check the correct data selected or not
{% endhighlight %}


before applying the above formula on the data we need to group the data state wise (as division is computational expensive, doing division for each region then adding up statewise will take a lot of computational power insted we will first addup the data then do the division in the end to save the critical computational resouce) for this the panda provide inbuild function to group the dataframes based on the particular columns.

{% highlight python %}
df_s = dfSS.groupby('State name').sum()           # this will group the data statewise and also sumup the other columns
df_sa =  df_s["Literate"]/df_s["Population"]*100  # to compute the literacy rate per state
df_sa                                             # Just to check the correct data selected or not  
{% endhighlight %}

This will generate the required data but the data need to be ploted in the graph in the increasing order (only need to show the state with lower literacy rate)

**note** : geographic maps are not possible at this state as to from the geographic map the longituted and latitude is needed which are not provided in the used case. So only bar graph is generated.

{% highlight python %}
df_sa.sort(inplace=True)            # this will sort the data in increasing order
df_sa.head(10).plot(kind='bar')     # this will generate the bar graph only for the first 10 entries
plt.show()                          # to display the graph
{% endhighlight %}

The output will look like this
