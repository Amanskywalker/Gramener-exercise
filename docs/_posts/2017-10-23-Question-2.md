Find out most similar districts in Bihar and Tamil Nadu. Similarity can be based on any of the columns from the data.

To solve the above question first of all need to seperate the data for the two states namely Bihar and Tamil Nadu, further need to detemine the columns on which we are determining the similarity. I took the "Workers" column to determin the similarity.

{% highlight python %}
dfc2 = df[["State name","District name","Workers"]]
dfc2.groupby("State name").head()
{% endhighlight %}

The above code fargment wiil took the narrowed the data in the dataframe.

{% highlight python %}
dfc2_b = dfc2[(dfc2['State name'] == 'BIHAR')]   # to only select the data where state name is BIHAR
dfc2_b                                           # only to verify data is correct or not
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
dfc2_t = dfc2[(dfc2['State name'] == 'TAMIL NADU')]   # to only select the data where state name is TAMIL NADU
dfc2_t                                                # only to verify data is correct or not
{% endhighlight %}

The above code will create two different dataframes, one for BIHAR related datas and other for the TAMIL NADU related data.

Now the problem is to find the similar districts, the problem arries whats the degree of change form the original values is accepted. I assumed 0.8% change (stored in dev). Second problem is that any district in one state can be similar to any district in other, forming many to many relationship.

{% highlight python %}
dev = 0.008
bdict = {}                                                    # to store the bihar districts
tdict = {}                                                    # to store the tamil nadu districts
for ti,ts,td,tw in dfc2_t.itertuples():
    x1 = tw-dev*tw
    x2 = tw+dev*tw
    for bi,bs,bd,bw in dfc2_b.itertuples():
        y1 = bw-dev*bw
        y2 = bw+dev*bw
        if ((x1<=bw) and (bw<=x2))or((y1<=tw) and (tw<=y2)):
          #  print td + " are similar " + bd                  # these are only to check which district is similar to which one in text form
          #  print "%d worker %d"%(tw,bw)                     # can be use for debugging the code   
            bdict[bd] = bw
            tdict[td] = tw
{% endhighlight %}

The above code compare each district of BIHAR with each district of TAMIL NADU, and store it in the dictinory for respective states. It also take in the account the change which are accpectable in determining similarity.

Now we have the data which shows the similar districts. Now need to plot it.

Before ploting, to make graph to look good, We can sort the data in increasing order.

{% highlight python %}
from collections import OrderedDict
from operator import itemgetter
db = OrderedDict(sorted(bdict.items(), key=itemgetter(1)))
dt = OrderedDict(sorted(tdict.items(), key=itemgetter(1)))
{% endhighlight %}

The Above code will sort data.

{%highlight python%}
n_groups = len(db)
# create plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
index = np.arange(n_groups)
bar_width = 0.35
opacity = 0.8
rects1 = plt.bar(index, dt.values(), bar_width,
                alpha=opacity,
                color='b',
                label='TN')

rects2 = plt.bar(index + bar_width, db.values(), bar_width,
                alpha=opacity,
                color='g',
                label='BH')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
lab = []
for (k,v), (k2,v2) in zip(dt.items(), db.items()):
    lab.append(k +"\n"+ k2)
plt.xticks(index + bar_width , lab)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
{%endhighlight%}

This code is used to plot the graph.

The output will look like this
